{"star_rating": "1", "review": "This game is very limited in the basic demo. Also, you can\u2019t code Minecraft unless you want to make up a whole new game. Finally, the picture of Minecraft looks unrealistic", "date": "2020-06-08 01:07:15"}
{"star_rating": "1", "review": "I don\u2019t really care for this game anymore, but I\u2019d still like to address some problems (personal and shared).\n\nFirst thing I\u2019d like to acknowledge is when there was a time when a code commonly used for dress-up games became broken. Very abruptly. And since some of the creators haven\u2019t gotten around to fixing their codes, many of those games are broken.\n\nSecond is the moderating system. I\u2019m pretty sure once I sent a project to be accepted but it wasn\u2019t even though I\u2019m confident there was nothing wrong with it (made it through the second time, though.) But there was a time where a quiz with a non-kid-friendly answer was included, and that left me wondering how that got through the system. But oh well, that was a while ago, hopefully it\u2019s changed...\n\nThird and last... why is there a remix button!? A lot of creators are frustrated with this cursed button. Many people are stealing content of people who\u2019ve worked very hard on their projects, and they won\u2019t even give credit and/or claim it as their own. It\u2019s just stupid. And even though I could care less about this game now, I remember how angry I was and still am when I realized how many people were stealing games that I worked so hard on and was so proud of, only to not receive any recognition. I can empathize with others as well.\n\nI emphasize on the third complaint. Thank you for your time, have a good day/night.", "date": "2020-06-05 04:45:50"}
