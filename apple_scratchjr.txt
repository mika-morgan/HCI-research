There is only a few colors, not a lot. I don\u2019t like that part, because I have a lot more things to use that mail thingy than just 6 colors. Can we maybe put a text, instead of colors? Like, any text. For example: \u201ccar\u201d. And on the character, you put the same text on that mail thingy. And the action happens. Also, why only 4 scenes? Can we add more than 4 scenes? I also want the audio recording quality a little better. There is this noise sound, it makes the recording sound a little glitchy, I also want to have a feature where you can just get audio from your audio library, or video library. \nThank you, I just want an improvement to make coding better.

On scratch Junior you can make stories and if you don\u2019t like the color of the character then you can change the color.

Also, some of the actions seem weirdly wrong. The most obvious example is that motion is screen-centric rather than object-centric, so if you turn the object, and move \"forward\", it moves to the right, not in the direction it is facing. This is counter-intuitive, and makes programming pretty difficult - actually, essentially impossible. Also, messages are global, which I can understand, but the kids I work with can't.
