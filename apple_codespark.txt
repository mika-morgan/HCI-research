My kids LOVE it so much! They play alone or together, sometimes on a video call with friends so they can share screens and work on designing levels together; which has been a great way to stay connected while physical distancing. I contacted customer service with a log in issue and it was quickly resolved. But then once logged back in, my kids\u2019 profiles were gone. Sandra went through 1,000s of emails and found that I had unknowingly created two accounts, one of which I entered my email wrong. She took so much time just to recover the lost profiles with all of my kids\u2019 levels they had made. I cannot tell you how wonderful she was!!! She was beyond kind and patient with me while resolving the mistake I had made. My daughter screamed in excitement when her profile was found! I honestly cannot say enough wonderful things about this app and company!"}

I saw an ad for this and hoped for the best. I downloaded it and apparently you must pay monthly for this. I understand it\u2019s how they make their money and what-not but I\u2019m only 14 and, of course, can\u2019t do monthly payments especially since my parents are both poor and against the idea of learning from something other than what the school teaches us. I haven\u2019t actually done any lessons or anything because I would have to pay which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the lessons could be amazing an work really well but I\u2019m pretty sure and kid who actually wants to learn and not be forced to do something like this by their parents or school would love it if their were a stripped down version of the app that one could use and learn to do at least simple coding would be greatly appreciated by anyone looking to learn who might not be able to pay because of the situation their in. Besides, shouldn\u2019t education be free? Especially for kids who want to learn?"}

CodeSpark was one of my first apps and one of my FAVORITE APPS. I played it everyday! I adore creating stories, and playing other coders games. Also, watching your little weekly fooville clips are so fun! But, I do wish you could communicate with other coders. I think the fact we could add an emoji or like someone\u2019s game or story is cool, but it still can be confusing. Like, the TROLL EMOJI. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!?!?!?!?! Also, the empty emoji. I worked so hard on my story and it just makes me very sad, though I have to respect their opinion. I just wish they could actually express why they thought it was empty. Communicating with other coders could help you make friends, get story ideas, and express your true feelings on someone else\u2019s game or story. Hope you respond back!"}

I love codeSpark academy and I definitely recommend it for other kids like me with that love for technology. Now on to complaints. Uuuumm let me think. Honestly, I can\u2019t think of a single complaint! And I\u2019ve reviewed a good couple of games and all of them have at least one complaint!

But it only glitches every once a year for me. Though I believe it\u2019s for a younger age group than me but how they make the coding as if they were games is really intriguing and also never gets old. At least in my case it never gets old. The developers in my opinion take their time to really make this app special. I really do thank the developers for making this app. (Meant to say app).

However, I do believe you're missing one key factor: our app is for kids as young as four years old. They use our app to learn computational thinking and key computer science concepts before some of them can even read. We're building the foundation for them to learn Java and other coding languages later in life. \n\ncodeSpark Academy is the ABC's of coding. Just like you wouldn't expect a teenager to know how to read or write without teaching them the alphabet when they're much younger, we can't expect kids to grasp very complicated coding/programming or even get excited about computer science at all if they don't first learn the basics when they're very small. \n\nOf course, not all kids are going to grow up to be programmers, but computers are an increasing presence in our lives and most careers are utilized or affected by them. Also, core concepts learned in codeSpark Academy also increase proficiency in math, reading comprehension, and even teamwork. \n\nSo, if you're an older teen or have experience in coding languages, there are plenty of other great apps out there that are far more appropriate for you.

Without practical practice, concepts don't stick. They learn through trial and error how to cultivate ideas from scratch, troubleshoot bugs they encounter, and build more and more complex games.

Children have many different ways of learning, so linear block coding, as found in our \"Learn\" chapters, may appeal more to one child, while more abstract concepts, such as those found in \"Pet Pals,\" are more engaging to another. codeSpark Academy is carefully scaffolded to allow children to learn at their own pace optimized by their innate learning style. \n\nWhile learning through \"Pet Pals\" our kid-coders can also unlock items that are then used in our sandbox area, \"Create,\" where they can code their own games. The more they play, the more they unlock. The more they go through our \"Learn\" chapters, the more complex their coding becomes as they unlock new skills and coding blocks.

Please encourage your child to play the Puzzles so they can earn coins to make their own games and remix the ones they play in the Community.

Please visit our Explore area to access our mini games like Pet Pals that teaches automation, Sweet Sorter for practice in sorting and pattern recognition, and other games that reinforce learned skills and teach new concepts.Building their own games is part of the learning-to-code process. Without practical practice, concepts don't stick. They learn through trial and error how to cultivate ideas from scratch, troubleshoot bugs they encounter, and build more and more complex games. All of this is necessary before learning an actual coding language. Our app is for kids ages four through nine, so our aim is to teach them the ABC's of computer science. Most schools and other programs don't teach kids these concepts, so when they start to learn a coding language, it's like throwing a novel into the hands of someone without teaching them the alphabet first and expecting them to read it cover to cover. So once our kid-coders have learned all of the skills and become experts by building their own games and being inspired by their community, they can take what they've learned at codeSpark Academy and excel with their solid computer science foundation.", "modified": "2021-06-15T15:13:39Z"}, "review": "My kid keeps playing the games from the marketplace.

Kid-coders start with \"Donut Detective\" and continue through the learning puzzles while they unlock other areas of the app. All areas are accessible during your free trial as long as your kids have unlocked them by completing certain tasks or levels.\n\nOnce they've finished the puzzles, kid-coders have learned the building blocks of computer science and programming. In our puzzle chapters, you'll notice headings like \"Donut Detective - Sequencing\" or \"Tool Trouble - Loops.\" In those puzzles, kids learn two very important computer science concepts and skills: sequencing and loops. They then move on to more complicated skills that build upon the once they've learned in the previous chapters.\n\nIn our Explore area kid-coders unlock access to our mini games like Pet Pals which teaches automation, Sweet Sorter for practice in sorting and pattern recognition, and other games that reinforce learned skills and teach new concepts. \n\nIf you have any other questions on game play, please feel free to let us know - we're happy to help!", "modified": "2020-06-23T17:20:34Z"}, "isEdited": false}

When content is reported, we have our moderation team take a second look at it and why our kid coders may have reported it.\n\nPlease send the Project ID of the game or story that was published to Support@codeSpark.com so we can look it up with that information and moderate it from there as well. If the item was published using a student profile, however, those stories are only shared inside the classroom and need to be moderated by the teacher.

In our puzzle chapters, you'll notice headings like \"Donut Detective - Sequencing\" or \"Tool Trouble - Loops.\" In those puzzles, kids learn two very important computer science concepts and skills: sequencing and loops. They then move on to more complicated skills that build upon the once they've learned in the previous chapters. In our Explore area kid-coders unlock access to our mini games like Pet Pals which teaches automation, Sweet Sorter for practice in sorting and pattern recognition, and other games that reinforce learned skills and teach new concepts. All of these are the building blocks of computer science and also build skills in math, reading comprehension, and teamwork. If you have any other questions on game play, please feel free to let us know - we're happy to help!", "modified": "2020-09-30T20:27:14Z"}, "rating": 1, "date": "2020-09-28 01:12:30", "isEdited": false, "title": "Why coding is for kids?", "userName": "Erlinda 0414**"}

All that being said, I\u2019m curious what type of code Codespark uses. I\u2019ve read a couple reviews saying Codespark prepares kids with basics for many coding languages, so I\u2019d be interested to know what coding language Codespark uses itself!

You guys know how you can choose a character to play as in the platform game? Whenever I press the button to do that, the screen goes black. I can still change the character, but I can\u2019t see anything.

Friends \nBy friends u can like friend people ya know and they can accept and decline and I can make little group chat with them and make it so they can\u2019t say bad words and numbers so they can\u2019t say ages\n\n3. Searching up story names \nSo we have the codes right what if u can\u2019t send the.

{"userName": "laychan1212", "title": "I HATE THIS", "rating": 1, "developerResponse": {"id": 24876257, "body": "Our app is a self-guided app for kids ages 5-9. We encourage learning through exploration, creativity, trial, and error. Kid-coders start with \"Donut Detective\" and continue through the puzzles learning computer science concepts and programming skills while familiarizing themselves with how each coding block works. Throughout their journey, they also unlock different areas of the app in Explore and Create as well as the next sets of puzzles. All areas are accessible during your free trial as long as your kids have unlocked them by completing certain tasks or levels.Once they've finished the puzzles, kid-coders have learned the building blocks of computer science and programming. In our puzzle chapters, you'll notice headings like \"Donut Detective - Sequencing\" or \"Tool Trouble - Loops.\" In those puzzles, kids learn two very important computer science concepts and skills: sequencing and loops. They then move on to more complicated skills that build upon the once they've learned in the previous chapters.\nIn our Explore area kid-coders unlock access to our mini games like Pet Pals which teaches automation, Sweet Sorter which introduces Boolean logic, Crocodile Catch with it's emphasis on math (variables), Splash Clash to practice their sequencing, and other games that reinforce learned skills and teach new concepts.Building their own games and coding their own stories is also part of the learning-to-code process. The Create area starts with a series of tutorials. Once they've passed those, they'll be able to successfully start creating their own games and coding their own stories. Without practical practice, concepts don't stick. In our this area, kid-coders learn through trial and error how to cultivate ideas from scratch or remix games created by our kid-coder community and be inspired by other kid-coders' stories, troubleshoot bugs they encounter, and build more and more complex games and stories. All of this is necessary before learning an actual coding language later in life. Our app is for kids ages five through nine, so our aim is to teach them the ABC's of computer science. Most schools and other programs don't teach kids these concepts, so when they start to learn a coding language, it's like throwing a novel into the hands of someone who has never learned the alphabet - and then expecting them to read it cover to cover! So once our kid-coders have learned all of the skills and become experts by building their own games and being inspired by their community, they can take what they've learned at codeSpark Academy and excel with their solid computer science foundation.", "modified": "2021-09-02T17:15:55Z"}, "date": "2021-08-31 21:39:21", "isEdited": false, "review": "This makes you pay 10 buck monthly for nothing.

I\u2019ve been playing this game for 2 years now, and it\u2019s super fun! I really only installed it because I wanted a coding app on my phone,  and this works for me! I really like it, the graphics are adorable, and the badges are an amazing touch. I don\u2019t really learn much, but that may be because I already knew C++ and Python, with some minimal knowledge of JavaScript, before installing this. I love coding with this app, it is really useful. It made learning to code easier for my siblings who have no coding background. It even works for kids who can\u2019t read yet, which is an amazing touch. Now, for an overview of the game. I love the publishing feature, I\u2019ve made a lot of games/plays with more than 1000 plays and it feels amazing every time. The minigames (splash clash, etc...) are amazing! I also like the puzzles (kite plight, etc...) and making games and games and stories is so fun. I absolutely love the filter on stories, it prevents giving away age and saying curse words. If you\u2019re a potential customer worried about your kid\u2019s safety, worry no more. This is a completely ad-free, explicit content free game. Now, you do have to pay around 80 dollars a year for it, which is slightly ridiculous in my mind, but it is worth it. The story creator is a bit limiting with only two blocks (a box and a hay bale) but is otherwise amazing. I have a few ideas for this app too... In Character Creator, I want to be able to put more than one outfit on at once. Maybe a wider color selection too. Also, having access to more than two face options (one female, with eyelashes and freckles, one male with a wide smile.) I also would like a few different code functions, like maybe a teleport in the game creator that allows you to teleport to a selected area, or something that can \u2018read\u2019 and process blocks (e.g. the player steps on a red block or a group of blocks, and the game sends out a signal (this could also be a function that isn\u2019t a code block, but inside the object as an addable condition, like the \u2018powers\u2019 section.)) That\u2019s it for now, hope you enjoyed my (long) review!", "date": "2021-06-27 02:10:04"}

The reason you get a stamp for publishing stories every 7 days is because each story is personally looked at by someone at team codeSpark to make sure it is safe and appropriate for our kid coder community. If we gave coders three stamps a day.... whoa! That would be waaay to many stories to watch and read and listen to. With one stamp a week, we make sure that every coder who submits their story, gets their story published in less than 2 days, usually faster. It would be awful if you worked really hard on a story and then had to wait weeks to see it published! And that's just what would happen if we gave out lots of stamps per week.

He has been playing Minecraft and watches YouTube videos about Minecraft and other video games so I wanted to get him something that would nurture that passion of his into learning.\nI was concerned that he would blow through this or get bored. He is moving extremely fast to get elements to build his own levels, but the games are fun and also challenging for him. I\u2019m still concerned that he will go through all the levels quickly but he has hundreds of items to buy so it will still take him some time. This format is excellent because in order to build different types of levels he has to play the other learning games, and the reward system is well balanced! Play a few learning games- earn a few hundred to a few thousand coins and go buy 1-5 new elements for the game building.\n\nThe reason I took a star away is that the game seems to crash frequently. Luckily progress is not lost when this happens but this is not good for an emotional 4 year old, or for an app I am soon going to be paying $10/mo for! I have also seen that the temple game with the gems that drop has a glitch where the character is no longer being effected by the items falling (whether it\u2019s adding or taking away). My son finds that game/math concept challenging at times and the glitch is not helpful. I almost took another star away because there is no support link or contact link on their website! I found the email here but I feel like I should be able to contact them once I\u2019m logged in.

Fourthly you could put stars \u2b50\ufe0f on Wild West pets and Crocodile catch! My fifth idea is why not put badges for splash clash? A sixth idea is that you could put tutorials about algorithms, debugging, and so on! My amazing seventh idea is that you could put a learning path in there! Eighthly, I know this has no reading \ud83d\udcd6 for prereaders but please put coding books \ud83d\udcda in there! My ninth idea is that you could put links included for other apps and websites! My tenth idea is to put other apps as good as this one! My eleventh idea is to put other coding languages so instead of only for 5-10 you could have 5-16! My twelvth idea is to put a grownup version of the app that you could call Codee! My thirteenth idea is to put a weekly list of challenges to do and if you complete them all you earn a reward! My Fourteenth idea is to put videos on YouTube to learn even without the app! My fifteenth idea is to mix coding with other skills for the school \ud83c\udfeb version! My sixteenth idea is to extend the seven day free trial to a monthly free trial! My seventeenth idea is to put more multiplayer games like splash clash! My eighteenth idea is to be able to chat with other people in the whole app and in the game maker along with emojis. My nineteenth idea is to put more puzzles and mini games into the app! Idea 20 and my final idea is to put arcade games \ud83d\udc7e\ud83d\udccdinto the app to reward yourself! I hope these are not too much and bye \ud83d\udc4b! And one more thing.

{"review": "I used the Foos from CodeSpark to introduce my 1st & 2nd graders to coding.  It was very engaging for students with the variety of characters, the \"star\" based feedback for performance and self pace.  I used it in a paired programming delivery first than allowed students to work independently with frequent teacher check in as a station.  When students were ready and moved on to independent work/play in the Foos... I found that there would often play through as far as they could go and disregard the number of \"stars\" they earned to reflect mastery of a level.  I would simply tell them they would need to go back through and work each level until they did master (earn all 3 stars) for each level before they could move on.\n\nI feel that the Foos is a great start... engagement is instantaneous.  I am looking forward to projected updates for the Fall.  It was really easy to set up to create student friendly logins. I really like the dashboard but I know I am not using it to it's full potential but it certainly meets my needs for my afterschool code club.   I still have a lot to test in the CodeSpark family of products as I work through more of the resources they have available.  I hope that the latest PD offerings will help me to integrate more of the products and levels with more of my student population.", "rating": 5, "title": "CodeSpark - the Foos for the Win!!", "isEdited": false, "date": "2018-06-28 14:23:09", "userName": "EdTechSmith"}

I thought about it and downloaded Mr.Coisa's carrots , But she thought it was worse than Minecraft SprachBox. I tried Pearl Chase, splitter critters, and journey through worlds, but none of the games were as good as The Foos. Later on, I downloaded a game called Mathy Foos.
