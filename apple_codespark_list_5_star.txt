They play alone or together, sometimes on a video call with friends so they can share screens and work on designing levels together; which has been a great way to stay connected while physical distancing. I contacted customer service with a log in issue and it was quickly resolved. But then once logged back in, my kids\u2019 profiles were gone. Sandra went through 1,000s of emails and found that I had unknowingly created two accounts, one of which I entered my email wrong. She took so much time just to recover the lost profiles with all of my kids\u2019 levels they had made. I cannot tell you how wonderful she was!!! She was beyond kind and patient with me while resolving the mistake I had made. My daughter screamed in excitement when her profile was found!

CodeSpark was one of my first apps and one of my FAVORITE APPS. I played it everyday! I adore creating stories, and playing other coders games. Also, watching your little weekly fooville clips are so fun! But, I do wish you could communicate with other coders. I think the fact we could add an emoji or like someone\u2019s game or story is cool, but it still can be confusing. Like, the TROLL EMOJI. WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?!?!?!?!?! Also, the empty emoji. I worked so hard on my story and it just makes me very sad, though I have to respect their opinion. I just wish they could actually express why they thought it was empty.

I remember using CodeSpark back in elementary school, and I feel it had definitely started me off on the right foot in regards to learning to code- as I\u2019m now in high school and taking a javascript class! All that being said, I\u2019m curious what type of code Codespark uses. I\u2019ve read a couple reviews saying Codespark prepares kids with basics for many coding languages, so I\u2019d be interested to know what coding language Codespark uses itself! Hope it\u2019s not too much trouble, and thank you for creating such a wonderful resource for kids to learn about the world of coding. Amazing app! :]", "date": "2022-05-04 09:53:35"}

But I do have a suggestion, I think we should be able to have more ways to get coins when we finish all the puzzle levels and stuff.\n\nOk, now here\u2019s the really big problem. You guys know how you can choose a character to play as in the platform game? Whenever I press the button to do that, the screen goes black. I can still change the character, but I can\u2019t see anything. Another glitch is in splash clash, when you are putting your code down, the screen goes black again and doesn\u2019t come back until the other player submits there code.\nI really love this game, I hope this will help for the next update.\nLOVE YOUR GAME!!! :)", "date": "2022-04-16 12:34:20"}

And also I have a few great ideas\ud83d\udc4d\ud83c\udffbto make you shine in the sky! First, you could put a drawing \u270d\ufe0f tool for story maker and game maker. Second, Why only put the picture tool in story maker? Thirdly, you could put weekly events and competitions to really make this app awesome \ud83d\ude0e!!!!! Fourthly you could put stars \u2b50\ufe0f on Wild West pets and Crocodile catch! My fifth idea is why not put badges for splash clash? A sixth idea is that you could put tutorials about algorithms, debugging, and so on! My amazing seventh idea is that you could put a learning path in there! Eighthly, I know this has no reading \ud83d\udcd6 for prereaders but please put coding books \ud83d\udcda in there! My ninth idea is that you could put links included for other apps and websites! My tenth idea is to put other apps as good as this one! My eleventh idea is to put other coding languages so instead of only for 5-10 you could have 5-16! My twelvth idea is to put a grownup version of the app that you could call Codee! My thirteenth idea is to put a weekly list of challenges to do and if you complete them all you earn a reward! My Fourteenth idea is to put videos on YouTube to learn even without the app! My fifteenth idea is to mix coding with other skills for the school \ud83c\udfeb version! My sixteenth idea is to extend the seven day free trial to a monthly free trial! My seventeenth idea is to put more multiplayer games like splash clash! My eighteenth idea is to be able to chat with other people in the whole app and in the game maker along with emojis. My nineteenth idea is to put more puzzles and mini games into the app! Idea 20 and my final idea is to put arcade games \ud83d\udc7e\ud83d\udccdinto the app to reward yourself! I hope these are not too much and bye \ud83d\udc4b! And one more thing.

{"star_rating": "5", "review": "I used the Foos from CodeSpark to introduce my 1st & 2nd graders to coding.  It was very engaging for students with the variety of characters, the \"star\" based feedback for performance and self pace.  I used it in a paired programming delivery first than allowed students to work independently with frequent teacher check in as a station.  When students were ready and moved on to independent work/play in the Foos... I found that there would often play through as far as they could go and disregard the number of \"stars\" they earned to reflect mastery of a level.  I would simply tell them they would need to go back through and work each level until they did master (earn all 3 stars) for each level before they could move on.\n\nI feel that the Foos is a great start... engagement is instantaneous.  I am looking forward to projected updates for the Fall.  It was really easy to set up to create student friendly logins. I really like the dashboard but I know I am not using it to it's full potential but it certainly meets my needs for my afterschool code club.   I still have a lot to test in the CodeSpark family of products as I work through more of the resources they have available.
