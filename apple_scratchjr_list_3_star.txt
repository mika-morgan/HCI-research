{"star_rating": "3", "review": "The app is fine, it\u2019s a good app for little kids but there is no need for a Scratch Jr because it\u2019s just Scratch with less blocks, more bugs and just less everything, really. Scratch doesn\u2019t even cost money. AND scratch is already for children! Tap the letters and they make funny sounds! Click on the face and it laughs! DRAG THE BALL WHEREVER YOU WANT! Those are all what Scratch Jr can do, but scratch can do things like: Press certain keys when the game tells you to! Hold this key for a certain amount of time! Griffpatch even made geometry dash! Just put normal scratch on the App Store. We don\u2019t need a bad version of scratch.", "date": "2019-07-12 16:21:39"}
{"star_rating": "3", "review": "Today I was playing scratch then I decided to search it up on the App Store, After doing that I saw scratch Jr. and scratch 2 one was 0.99 other was free I downloaded and guess what I got, Something that looks like a fake. I understand that it is made for kids but why is the other 0.99? I Got 0.49 witch is kinda sad, Can you please make one free?\nI would LOVE to get a credit card but I don\u2019t know any way to stores. Maybe the other one will be like the website OR maybe not other than that the app is great and kinda boring Thanks if you help :)", "date": "2021-10-08 21:22:54"}

The record feature doesn't seem to be available when the students create their own sprites. It freezes a lot. It also loses a lot of projects. But the biggest drawback is that their isn't any way to export a project once it is finished. I would like to be able to upload to the Scratch site both directly and via an export to iTunes. It would also be helpful if a video of the running of the code could be exported.", "date": "2014-12-03 15:41:15"}
