{"star_rating": "4", "review": "I love the app! I did run into a few bugs. When writing text and using a caution emoji in that text, it would glitch and exit, when in playmode, when walking by the object I used that emoji on. Also some of the puzzle levels on the first 4 sections won't unlock. It just has a star with 22 inside it. How do I unlock those levels? And under the Pet Pals the new items I'm suppose to use throughout the days aren't showing up. Just the first 3. Other than a few bugs, I've really enjoyed this app.", "date": "2022-05-27 19:26:05"}
