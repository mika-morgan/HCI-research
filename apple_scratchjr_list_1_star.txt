{"star_rating": "1", "review": "This is intended to be a kids programming language, but it's so over-simplified as to not be the least bit fun, even for kids. Also, some of the actions seem weirdly wrong. The most obvious example is that motion is screen-centric rather than object-centric, so if you turn the object, and move \"forward\", it moves to the right, not in the direction it is facing. This is counter-intuitive, and makes programming pretty difficult - actually, essentially impossible. Also, messages are global, which I can understand, but the kids I work with can't. Overall, this seems a poor cousin to other much richer programming apps for kids.", "date": "2015-03-16 15:19:03"}
