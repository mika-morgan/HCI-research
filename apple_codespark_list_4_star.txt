I love stories and you can even make interactive stories and it\u2019s so fun. I like this game and all but I\u2019m hoping for chat, and I don\u2019t mean where you can type stuff I mean like quick chat, in among us (not related to codeSpark) quick chat is like emojis in codeSpark just without the emojis, there are specific words that you have a option to tap on.

Number 2 too many restrictions, you\u2019re not adding block and basically I want to add like a cannon in my game and make point towards the player but there isn\u2019t any possible way to do that. number 3 glitches that have been around for a long time still isn\u2019t fixed, a lot of kid coders have stuff I don\u2019t but I\u2019ve updated CodeSpark to it\u2019s highest point but still don\u2019t have it.

{"star_rating": "4", "review": "Hi! I\u2019ve been playing this game for 2 years now, and it\u2019s super fun! I really only installed it because I wanted a coding app on my phone,  and this works for me! I really like it, the graphics are adorable, and the badges are an amazing touch. I don\u2019t really learn much, but that may be because I already knew C++ and Python, with some minimal knowledge of JavaScript, before installing this. I love coding with this app, it is really useful. It made learning to code easier for my siblings who have no coding background. It even works for kids who can\u2019t read yet, which is an amazing touch. Now, for an overview of the game. I love the publishing feature, I\u2019ve made a lot of games/plays with more than 1000 plays and it feels amazing every time. The minigames (splash clash, etc...) are amazing! I also like the puzzles (kite plight, etc...) and making games and games and stories is so fun. I absolutely love the filter on stories, it prevents giving away age and saying curse words. If you\u2019re a potential customer worried about your kid\u2019s safety, worry no more. This is a completely ad-free, explicit content free game. Now, you do have to pay around 80 dollars a year for it, which is slightly ridiculous in my mind, but it is worth it. The story creator is a bit limiting with only two blocks (a box and a hay bale) but is otherwise amazing. I have a few ideas for this app too... In Character Creator, I want to be able to put more than one outfit on at once. Maybe a wider color selection too. Also, having access to more than two face options (one female, with eyelashes and freckles, one male with a wide smile.) I also would like a few different code functions, like maybe a teleport in the game creator that allows you to teleport to a selected area, or something that can \u2018read\u2019 and process blocks (e.g. the player steps on a red block or a group of blocks, and the game sends out a signal (this could also be a function that isn\u2019t a code block, but inside the object as an addable condition, like the \u2018powers\u2019 section.)) That\u2019s it for now, hope you enjoyed my (long) review!", "date": "2021-06-27 02:10:04"}
{"star_rating": "4", "review": "My son is 4 and he loves to create. He has been playing Minecraft and watches YouTube videos about Minecraft and other video games so I wanted to get him something that would nurture that passion of his into learning.\nI was concerned that he would blow through this or get bored. He is moving extremely fast to get elements to build his own levels, but the games are fun and also challenging for him. I\u2019m still concerned that he will go through all the levels quickly but he has hundreds of items to buy so it will still take him some time. This format is excellent because in order to build different types of levels he has to play the other learning games, and the reward system is well balanced! Play a few learning games- earn a few hundred to a few thousand coins and go buy 1-5 new elements for the game building.\n\nThe reason I took a star away is that the game seems to crash frequently. Luckily progress is not lost when this happens but this is not good for an emotional 4 year old, or for an app I am soon going to be paying $10/mo for! I have also seen that the temple game with the gems that drop has a glitch where the character is no longer being effected by the items falling (whether it\u2019s adding or taking away). My son finds that game/math concept challenging at times and the glitch is not helpful. I almost took another star away because there is no support link or contact link on their website! I found the email here but I feel like I should be able to contact them once I\u2019m logged in.
