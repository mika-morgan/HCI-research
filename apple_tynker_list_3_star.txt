{"star_rating": "3", "review": "I'm a really great coder and stuff. But, there are a few things I hate about it! One: my projects are now taking for ever to be reviewed! What is up with that! It's been taking MONTHS for my good quality projects to come in! Two: I posted a game on my laptop which would've gotten featured. But no. Instead it got rejected! There are vampires, and the mention of blood. But no violence or anything bad! And further more, I saw it got rejected on the TYNKER APP! I was using my laptop. Plus, there were no rules against my game. This proves my point that Tynker is treating their viewers like babies! On Scratch, everyone would\u2019ve loved it! Three: make the site a bit more for older kids! I mean, why do you even have a monster for a mascot! Adding to this review, a lot of the games here (excuse my French) ARE GARBAGE! I also use scratch, so I know the huge difference between Tynker and Scratch. On scratch, most of the community projects are more advanced and fun to play! Most of the games I see on Tynker are\u2026Not that good. So in conclusion, this is NOT worth your money! You can easily get on a better coding platform for free! But you choose to go here.

{"star_rating": "3", "review": "Well, I make lots of projects, but I switched to Scratch because the community makes lots of bad, bad projects. I searched up 2048 and the Tynker community makes very bad looking tiles that just moves to where your finger is. When I look up 2048 on Scratch, they actually put effort and the game is similar to the real 2048 game. The tiles move like they are supposed to, the tiles add up, etc. Another problem is that you won\u2019t let us make the rest of the Minecraft mobs. Another problem is that in Minecraft, you won\u2019t let us type our own commands into the system. You can\u2019t place command blocks with the editor. Also, you have to manually create a variable to place a command block. Another problem is that anybody can report anything. If I report a featured project, IT\u2019S GONE. You don\u2019t even care to check. Also, I\u2019ve made a good project that converts numbers like 420 and 69 to Roman numerals. SOMEBODY REPORTED IT FOR NO REASON.
