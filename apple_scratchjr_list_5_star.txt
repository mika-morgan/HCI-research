One of the best things about this is it\u2019s free. I like normal scratch, but this is easier. Just... more messages and maybe some variables (but don\u2019t call the variables!) and this would PERFECT!!! Also I want more costumes.  And more backdrops. And I want the characters to be able to say more. Hmm... I also want characters to change color and also be able to change costumes.

{"star_rating": "5", "review": "My 5 year old learned to \"code\" in one weekend!  You have made me a believer that really small children can learn to code and enjoy it!  Thank you for creating this simpler version.  It is easy to use and not intimidating.  Now if there is a way to share the projects (i.e. Grandma/grandpa) without being tied to the app, we would be in heaven.  Thanks again and keep up you brilliant work!!!", "date": "2015-12-14 16:27:04"}

Incredibly exciting to finally see the platform on the iPad. I made my first animation in just a few minutes. I can't wait to see all the great things kids create. Congrats to the MIT and Tufts team!", "date": "2014-07-30 12:02:21"}
