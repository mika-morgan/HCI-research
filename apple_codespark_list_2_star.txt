{"star_rating": "2", "review": "Hello, I\u2019m 14 and my school doesn\u2019t have any classes or really anything on coding and I would love to learn how and where to start and all that, so I took it upon myself to learn how. I saw an ad for this and hoped for the best. I downloaded it and apparently you must pay monthly for this. I understand it\u2019s how they make their money and what-not but I\u2019m only 14 and, of course, can\u2019t do monthly payments especially since my parents are both poor and against the idea of learning from something other than what the school teaches us. I haven\u2019t actually done any lessons or anything because I would have to pay which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because the lessons could be amazing an work really well but I\u2019m pretty sure and kid who actually wants to learn and not be forced to do something like this by their parents or school would love it if their were a stripped down version of the app that one could use and learn to do at least simple coding would be greatly appreciated by anyone looking to learn who might not be able to pay because of the situation their in.

I understand the need to earn money but who in their right mind thinks it makes sense to spend 120 dollars a year to use this app?  You can pay a one time payment less than that for full access to professional apps, games, software, etc. out there of equal or better production value.  No offense to the developers but, making a point.  This should be a one time payment offering that includes a sampling of different games and development access.  Then added costs for downloadable content.  Subscriptions of this type are just a way to take advantage of consumers and milk them for money whether they use the app or not.", "date": "2019-11-16 21:05:13"}
