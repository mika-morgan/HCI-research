{"star_rating": "4", "review": "I use Tynker a lot! Not for the main part, but for the Minecraft modding and coding projects. They are right at my level and I enjoy using it. Over my 5 months of using it, I have gathered some feedback for the creation system, and I finally have enough to make a review on it.\n\n1. You need to update your things! It\u2019s so old it doesn\u2019t have a bucket of milk! Let alone, the new textures and netherite! As I\u2019m writing this review some time after the release of the 1.19 Wild Update, I think it\u2019s time you focus on the Minecraft stuff a bit more!\n\n2. You need to think about multiplayer! I keep trying to make my mods, but I have to use tags to add categories! I have to make a hundred tags to allow for every single person to have their own profile! As someone who makes lots of multiplayer games, I really think you need to work on the exclusives!\n\n3. A lot of times, I write similar code in order to match different categories. But one issue I run into a lot is (And I can\u2019t stress this enough) YOU NEED TO ALLOW US TO DUPLICATE SCRIPT!!\n\n3 1/2. You need to make things easier to configure. One time, I made a big spelling error in my variable. When I tried to modify it, I realized I would have to redo EVERYTHING! The spelling error still bugs me to this day!\n\n4. You really need to explain things better. When I try to learn about a block, the lesson becomes a paradox! Please make it easier to understand! (Maybe a video?)\n\n5. This is like the duplicate thing, but just let me undo something. Sometimes I make a mistake, and then I have to spend 20 minutes trying to fix it in my \u201clibrary of endless MC mod code.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s the end of my rant! Thank you for reading all the way to the end, and please, don\u2019t just say \u201cThank you for your feedback! We will take this under consideration!\u201d These are serious issues, and as a 10 year old, it\u2019s really beginning to bug me. If I find any more issues, I\u2019ll edit this, but for now, please just fix it, and stop focusing on the main coding things, or at least update your MC Mod Creator!", "date": "2022-06-11 00:50:39"}

{"star_rating": "4", "review": "OK. It is really good, but I have some problems. TYNKER PLS READ! So, 1 big bad thing about the app is that IT DOES NOT HAVE A LOT OF THE SAME THINGS THAT THE WEBSITE HAS! IT HAS LESS SOUNDS, LESS ACTORS THAT THE WEBSITE HAS, LESS BACKGROUNDS, NO ROVERS, NO TEEN CHARACTERS, NO ABILITY TO ADD YOUR OWN SOUNDS, AND A FEW LESS BLOCKS! ADD THOSE ON THE APP, OR ELSE\u2026 THAT IS THE REASON THAT THERE ARE LESS GOOD PROJECTS! PEOPLE DUNNO HOW TO ADD A SOUND! But you can kinda experience the website in the app by 1. Going to Crystal Clash. 2. Pressing edit on any of the characters you have made. 3. Press the Upside-Down arrow by the save button. 4. Press make new project. But there is 1 problem, when you try to add a sound, it crashes. Also, WHY DID MY USERNAME CHANGE FROM jj studios! TO deleted- THEN BLA BLA BLA? AM I BANNED? AM I NOT ABLE TO PUBLISH ANY MORE PROJECTS? But the rest is good. -JJ studios!", "date": "2021-12-22 02:09:32"}

So when I found out that BTS is going to be taking a probable SEVEN YEAR HIATUS, I KNEW I had to tell all the BTS fans on Tynker. But here is the thing: Some of my projects have been in review for like two weeks. So I was so frustrated when I saw my \u201cBTS fans only...\u201d had been REJECTED, I was so upset that I literally threw my IPhone to the other side of the room and CRACKED a bit. How could my project that had been out since YESTERDAY already be ranked rejected, but my projects that have been reviewed 4 WEEKS not been decided yet?!?! I\u2019m going into fifth grade, and for tech class, we are using tynker more often, and I want to show my tech teacher that I can code well, but NO HECKIN WAY am I showing one of my projects that have been rejected!!! She will think I code terribly!!!!! Plus. Can there be more free things, and less things that cost more..? It\u2019s a good app I guess. But just saying. Broke my screen a bit.

It would be super uesful for my survival island game other then that it\u2019s a really good app oh ya also make it so you can record your own sound for your game also bluringn out swear words or completly removeing them from the recording cause I don\u2019t wanna hear any of those.

{"star_rating": "4", "review": "I think it\u2019s a really good app. It\u2019s the best mod creator I\u2019ve ever seen. But it has some flaws. First of all, I think it needs to be updated so I can code the bee, or the fox, or maybe even the hoglin. I also think that you shouldn\u2019t have tp pay 95 DOLLARS after a week. Third of all, I think that you shouldn\u2019t have to pay to code certain mobs, for example the ocelot. I also think you should be able to code items too, like a diamond pickaxe that explodes when it runs out of durability. In conclusion I think it is a very good game but needs a few improvements. P.S. I would totally give it 5 star if at least one of those are added.", "date": "2020-02-28 02:02:08"}
{"star_rating": "4", "review": "I personally love tynker, I can create amazing games, and Minecraft items. I used to have over 1M views, but then the bots came. The platform is flawed in many ways, the developers at tynker need to listen to the real creators. First of all the review system, with remixing needs to be changed, some little kids will change one little tiny piece of code, and it will be accepted and they will get the credit for the work they didn\u2019t do. When I created Dots.io, and Tynker Turbo, the games got featured, but the bots though they were inappropriate so when the games had almost 1M they got took down! It feels bad for the progress you made to be took away. Second of all updates, and lag. The app tynker made almost feels unsupported in a way. The app will get tiny bug fixes, but nothing major, please make paint system better with vector. Tynker released a new look, and I love it, but can you please make the app look nice too! Let\u2019s talk about BUGS! Tynker has a ton of bugs, me and BT-YT have sent a list to tynker already. The lag on Tynker is horrible for big games. The small games kids make are fine, but if you are trying to run 40 loops, and 130 scripts it\u2019s going to die. Please Tynker please fix your stuff, and community, please listen to the people.
