{"star_rating": "3", "review": "ScratchJr is a very fun app to play it's for kids and beginners to code. I played ScratchJr before, but I changed to Scratch (Normal Version). The reason is the projects I've done was gone, I put a lot of effort in it. But when I check it a week later, it is gone. And the app started glitching, the colour palette for drawing is also gone. Please fix the glitch, and if you can, please help me get my project back. Thank you.", "date": "2022-08-23 03:27:56"}

{"star_rating": "3", "review": "Fun but something is quite different... The sprites are only 4 available and we want more than 4 sprites. I mean why only 4? Also while drawing, I sometimes draw lines but it automatically connects to another line which makes it a bit worse than Scratch. Also please add a few blocks (not much but at least a few would make me happier).", "date": "2022-06-19 21:48:52"}
