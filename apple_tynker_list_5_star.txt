I have 3 favorites: the Barbie coding, the dragon coding, and the astronaut coding. I am 10 years old, and am going into 5th grade. I know this will give me some idea of how my year will go, since I can now figure out my problems. This was, and still is very educational, and I would recommend this too any young mind wanting to learn and study coding. \n\nFor the company who made and coded this app, I would like for you to know, that I am very grateful that you put this app into the world. \n\nThanks!

A suggestion is to add a function so you can grab and move around the object you drew. Just make it similar to scratches design studio. Another thing is the sound. You can\u2019t record. I suggest adding that so we don\u2019t have to use most of the sounds it provides. The final thing is to add contents from the laptop version. We could really use what you aren\u2019t providing.

My 8 year old and my 13 year old both were really captivated by this app.\n\nA few suggestions: It would be nice to get more themes besides the three that are here, and I had to restart the download a few times before it made it. But, these are minor problems. \n\nKudos to the Tynker team for a cool \"entertainment-based learning\" app!", "date": "2014-03-06 22:02:48"}

My daughter has special needs cognitive and health, and this program has been a great asset to build her confidence and spend quality educational time on the iPad. Recently she had another IQ test (done annually to gage any progress or regression) and for the first time she hit an average score in 1 area. Its basically the same category as programming would be.

{"star_rating": "5", "review": "This app combines the code challenges to learn skills with the ability to create or modify games using visual code. Excellent way to start programming for kids who are comfortable reading a bit.", "date": "2014-11-14 04:29:38"}
{"star_rating": "5", "review": "This is an amazing app, you can add chunks of code to make programs. But there is 1 thing! Please make it so you can add your own pictures from camera roll! (And if you can have it be able to cut out the picture if they don't have a transparent background) And also please make it so you can submit your app to the App Store like in Codea, Thank you in advance.", "date": "2014-08-29 01:44:37"}
{"star_rating": "5", "review": "This is the best ever iPad game that I have seen. My 9 year old is hooked to it in just 2 days. While discussing the laser game, I was able to explain geometric properties to her in a way that she was genuinely interested in understanding. The simple way this program teaches how to code is mind boggling. I have never written a review of any iPad apps ever, but am taking time to do it for you guys. Your app forced me to do this. Kudos to you guys!! Keep up the great work that you have done. My best wishes for your effort.", "date": "2014-07-26 17:47:42"}
