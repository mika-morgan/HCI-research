However, in the Tynker app, the forward blocks goes only up to 3 seconds thus requiring another block and not meeting the minimum number of blocks.  The quiz questions in the Answer Key, in Lesson 1, have 10 questions.  Yet the Tynker app only has 5 questions and do not match.", "date": "2020-02-05 22:09:55"}

{"star_rating": "2", "review": "Ok, FIRST OF ALL, let\u2019s talk about the community. The quality of some of the projects are very bad, For example: Someone remixed my Spring dress up and used it to troll people! That just makes me look bad! Also, people on community don\u2019t care for hard work, in fact, most of the projects are terribly overrated. Second, let\u2019s talk about my experience, first of all, I work really hard on my projects but most of them just get EXTREMELY underrated, it\u2019s true. In fact, my only 2 featured projects didn\u2019t even take that much effort. Next, let\u2019s talk about all the picky people, first of all, if you make a dress up, you have to make the right kind, or else you won\u2019t get a lot of likes. I mean, how much sense does that make? NO SENSE. Also, if you want to be famous on Tynker, you have to make dress up games, and be a good anime artist! It\u2019s true, all of the famous people have good art and featured dress up games. And let\u2019s not forget about all the STUPIDLY ANNOYING glitches! Like my how my GachaLife videos won\u2019t publish! (Side note: If you enjoy GachaLife you should get Gacha club. Lastly, let\u2019s talk about publishing issues: THE MOST COMMON ONE: My projects are taking ETERNITYS to publish, lots of people complain about this, but Tynker still has not fixed it! Also, people on tynker are not toddlers! One of my old projects mentioned blood, and it wasn\u2019t gore! But it was still rejected! And why won\u2019t you publish my Gacha vids?! Every time I try, it just glitches and syncs the project instead! I wanted Tynker to be an alternative Gachtube channel for me! Instead, I have to wait until I retire to start a Gacha channel! (I\u2019m going to work as an engineer or doctor, so I have to wait until I retire). Also one more question: WHY DOESN\u2019T APPLEPEN/APPLEPENCIL WORK ON TYNKER?!!!!!! Pls fix, oh and I probably sound like a Karen, but I am NOT. I rarely give reviews like this, which means Tynker definitely has sum major bugs to fix. I might as well just switch to scratch. But I can\u2019t find it on app store.", "date": "2022-06-13 11:32:07"}

{"star_rating": "2", "review": "There are many bugs and glitches in the app that I have found so far. I constantly have to tap on the blocks so I can type on them or move them. The app freezes when I am tying to use the blocks and other aspects. Sword clanging noise comes out of no where and it just isn't that user friendly. There is no real tutorial, adding one and fixing the glitches would dramatically improve the app. Possibly you could add an animated tutorial to attract kids attention.

{"star_rating": "2", "review": "Tynker is a simple block coding program that can be used to make anything from short animations to your own small game. These can be uploaded to Tynker for others to play. The app is powerful, but is very lacking compared to PC. Some downsides of Tynker include numerous bugs, and uncommon but sometimes data-deleting crashes. The speed at which code is run can often be limiting, and the search system for projects is terrible. Finding one project is impossible if it wasn\u2019t recently uploaded and you don\u2019t know the name. There is a featured projects category that the mods can choose to include projects in, but oftentimes great complex projects that show coding potential are excluded in place of repetitive and simple dress-ups. Some blocks are available on PC but not on mobile, and images imported on mobile lose resolution for some reason. Many blocks either have hard to understand, vague descriptions, or lack one altogether. I love to use this app, but it and the mod team has many issues. I hope to see this app updated in the future to become more usable and similar in quality to programs such as Scratch.", "date": "2019-07-28 10:03:25"}
