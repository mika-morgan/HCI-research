There is difficulty, but every time I mess up the app helps me. I have 3 favorites: the Barbie coding, the dragon coding, and the astronaut coding. I am 10 years old, and am going into 5th grade. I know this will give me some idea of how my year will go, since I can now figure out my problems. This was, and still is very educational, and I would recommend this too any young mind wanting to learn and study coding. \n\nFor the company who made and coded this app, I would like for you to know, that I am very grateful that you put this app into the world. \n\nThanks!

But, there are a few things I hate about it! One: my projects are now taking for ever to be reviewed! What is up with that! It's been taking MONTHS for my good quality projects to come in! Two: I posted a game on my laptop which would've gotten featured. But no. Instead it got rejected! There are vampires, and the mention of blood. But no violence or anything bad! And further more, I saw it got rejected on the TYNKER APP! I was using my laptop. Plus, there were no rules against my game. This proves my point that Tynker is treating their viewers like babies! On Scratch, everyone would\u2019ve loved it! Three: make the site a bit more for older kids! I mean, why do you even have a monster for a mascot! Adding to this review, a lot of the games here (excuse my French) ARE GARBAGE! I also use scratch, so I know the huge difference between Tynker and Scratch. On scratch, most of the community projects are more advanced and fun to play! Most of the games I see on Tynker are\u2026Not that good. So in conclusion, this is NOT worth your money! You can easily get on a better coding platform for free! But you choose to go here. Dat is all. \ud83d\udc84\u2764\ufe0f ouuuuutttt."}

I searched up 2048 and the Tynker community makes very bad looking tiles that just moves to where your finger is. When I look up 2048 on Scratch, they actually put effort and the game is similar to the real 2048 game. The tiles move like they are supposed to, the tiles add up, etc. Another problem is that you won\u2019t let us make the rest of the Minecraft mobs. Another problem is that in Minecraft, you won\u2019t let us type our own commands into the system. You can\u2019t place command blocks with the editor. Also, you have to manually create a variable to place a command block. Another problem is that anybody can report anything. If I report a featured project, IT\u2019S GONE. You don\u2019t even care to check. Also, I\u2019ve made a good project that converts numbers like 420 and 69 to Roman numerals. SOMEBODY REPORTED IT FOR NO REASON. I have reported many projects because it made me a bit frustrated that people who are in 5th grade makes this stuff."}

{"review": "So usual day on the AppStore lookin for somethin then I find Tynker that my friend had told me about it like 3 weeks ago so I read some views so I downloaded it and once it was downloaded I tried it the next day.(day 2)so I got the app and saw mythicraft and tapped on it and u could make mods creation or re paint stuff and new skins but I sighed as home because it was after school so and I was home and I created my a couple creations and it was time to go to bed i so turned it off.(day 3)I woke up this morning to play and I was lookin at my creations to see if they had some views or likes but they didn\u2019t but I created some more played with them on Minecraft and I had  soccer practice so I went and got home it was late ate dinner went to bed.(day 4)I woke this morning hoping I had some views and likes but I didn\u2019t til I noticed at the picture of my creation on the right bottom corner that there was a purple tag saying rejected and I was like what? And so I thought that meant because I was home instead of school and ps we don\u2019t use tynker at school or aloud to bring electronics so I switched the log in school and all of them had said published and I\u2019m like now I can share them.(day 5)I woke ate breakfast got on tynker and decided to make something and I was done and I published it and I looked down at the picture of my creation and had said flippen rejected and I\u2019m like seriously! I switched to home and waited a lil but then nothing then switched to school and then nothing happens and I was disappointed.(day 6)I woke up got on tynker and looked at the published and no views and no likes and I was mad at then because I could share them with friends but I couldn\u2019t because YOUR game glitched or messed up or something and I wrote today because now I can\u2019t do anything about and u can cause your the developer and your the head admin of the app so plz reply and tell me what I can do and get it working again thank you for reading this whole entire problem and also ty for being patient reading this", "date": "2019-09-27 22:20:48", "userName": "Nilnej", "isEdited": false, "title": "Home and school are switched I am getting rejected on my projects why?", "rating": 3}

{"isEdited": false, "review": "Ok, FIRST OF ALL, let\u2019s talk about the community. The quality of some of the projects are very bad, For example: Someone remixed my Spring dress up and used it to troll people! That just makes me look bad! Also, people on community don\u2019t care for hard work, in fact, most of the projects are terribly overrated. Second, let\u2019s talk about my experience, first of all, I work really hard on my projects but most of them just get EXTREMELY underrated, it\u2019s true. In fact, my only 2 featured projects didn\u2019t even take that much effort. Next, let\u2019s talk about all the picky people, first of all, if you make a dress up, you have to make the right kind, or else you won\u2019t get a lot of likes. I mean, how much sense does that make? NO SENSE. Also, if you want to be famous on Tynker, you have to make dress up games, and be a good anime artist! It\u2019s true, all of the famous people have good art and featured dress up games. And let\u2019s not forget about all the STUPIDLY ANNOYING glitches! Like my how my GachaLife videos won\u2019t publish! (Side note: If you enjoy GachaLife you should get Gacha club. Lastly, let\u2019s talk about publishing issues: THE MOST COMMON ONE: My projects are taking ETERNITYS to publish, lots of people complain about this, but Tynker still has not fixed it! Also, people on tynker are not toddlers! One of my old projects mentioned blood, and it wasn\u2019t gore! But it was still rejected! And why won\u2019t you publish my Gacha vids?! Every time I try, it just glitches and syncs the project instead! I wanted Tynker to be an alternative Gachtube channel for me! Instead, I have to wait until I retire to start a Gacha channel! (I\u2019m going to work as an engineer or doctor, so I have to wait until I retire). Also one more question: WHY DOESN\u2019T APPLEPEN/APPLEPENCIL WORK ON TYNKER?!!!!!! Pls fix, oh and I probably sound like a Karen, but I am NOT. I rarely give reviews like this, which means Tynker definitely has sum major bugs to fix. I might as well just switch to scratch. But I can\u2019t find it on app store.", "date": "2022-06-13 11:32:07", "title": "Scratch rip-off", "userName": "Gacha_AnimecloudZ", "rating": 2}

They are right at my level and I enjoy using it. Over my 5 months of using it, I have gathered some feedback for the creation system, and I finally have enough to make a review on it.\n\n1. You need to update your things! It\u2019s so old it doesn\u2019t have a bucket of milk! Let alone, the new textures and netherite! As I\u2019m writing this review some time after the release of the 1.19 Wild Update, I think it\u2019s time you focus on the Minecraft stuff a bit more!\n\n2. You need to think about multiplayer! I keep trying to make my mods, but I have to use tags to add categories! I have to make a hundred tags to allow for every single person to have their own profile! As someone who makes lots of multiplayer games, I really think you need to work on the exclusives!\n\n3. A lot of times, I write similar code in order to match different categories. But one issue I run into a lot is (And I can\u2019t stress this enough) YOU NEED TO ALLOW US TO DUPLICATE SCRIPT!!\n\n3 1/2. You need to make things easier to configure. One time, I made a big spelling error in my variable. When I tried to modify it, I realized I would have to redo EVERYTHING! The spelling error still bugs me to this day!\n\n4. You really need to explain things better. When I try to learn about a block, the lesson becomes a paradox! Please make it easier to understand! (Maybe a video?)\n\n5.

{"rating": 3, "userName": "huop mam!", "review": "This program is good for mobile if you want the Scratch experience on the go. Even though it\u2019s on PC, and that came first, Scratch is the tried and true. Crashes constantly, and could have more designer freedom. Coding in traditional languages is strict and weird. The PC community is thriving, but the games are usually on a lower quality to Scratch. A mobile app export feature like code.org could be nice. It\u2019s quite smart having Minecraft mods, and blocks because it kind of allows a gateway to coding, and a 3D feature too. Lessons cost money, and feel like an afterthought. If you learn it enough, it can teach you how coding works, but you may need further assistance with more complex learning for commands in those programs, and it\u2019s debugging system. The old version of R is great for beginners, as well as JavaScript and Python. Even RPGMaker might be a good choice, with it\u2019s framework, but it doesn\u2019t have the same structure for teaching, so it might not be a good idea unless you add in R.

Going to Crystal Clash. 2. Pressing edit on any of the characters you have made. 3. Press the Upside-Down arrow by the save button. 4. Press make new project.

Very abruptly. And since some of the creators haven\u2019t gotten around to fixing their codes, many of those games are broken.\n\nSecond is the moderating system. I\u2019m pretty sure once I sent a project to be accepted but it wasn\u2019t even though I\u2019m confident there was nothing wrong with it (made it through the second time, though.) But there was a time where a quiz with a non-kid-friendly answer was included, and that left me wondering how that got through the system. But oh well, that was a while ago, hopefully it\u2019s changed...\n\nThird and last... why is there a remix button!? A lot of creators are frustrated with this cursed button. Many people are stealing content of people who\u2019ve worked very hard on their projects, and they won\u2019t even give credit and/or claim it as their own. It\u2019s just stupid. And even though I could care less about this game now, I remember how angry I was and still am when I realized how many people were stealing games that I worked so hard on and was so proud of, only to not receive any recognition.

The platform is flawed in many ways, the developers at tynker need to listen to the real creators. First of all the review system, with remixing needs to be changed, some little kids will change one little tiny piece of code, and it will be accepted and they will get the credit for the work they didn\u2019t do. When I created Dots.io, and Tynker Turbo, the games got featured, but the bots though they were inappropriate so when the games had almost 1M they got took down! It feels bad for the progress you made to be took away. Second of all updates, and lag. The app tynker made almost feels unsupported in a way. The app will get tiny bug fixes, but nothing major, please make paint system better with vector. Tynker released a new look, and I love it, but can you please make the app look nice too! Let\u2019s talk about BUGS! Tynker has a ton of bugs, me and BT-YT have sent a list to tynker already. The lag on Tynker is horrible for big games. The small games kids make are fine, but if you are trying to run 40 loops, and 130 scripts it\u2019s going to die. Please Tynker please fix your stuff, and community, please listen to the people.

These can be uploaded to Tynker for others to play. The app is powerful, but is very lacking compared to PC. Some downsides of Tynker include numerous bugs, and uncommon but sometimes data-deleting crashes. The speed at which code is run can often be limiting, and the search system for projects is terrible. Finding one project is impossible if it wasn\u2019t recently uploaded and you don\u2019t know the name. There is a featured projects category that the mods can choose to include projects in, but oftentimes great complex projects that show coding potential are excluded in place of repetitive and simple dress-ups. Some blocks are available on PC but not on mobile, and images imported on mobile lose resolution for some reason. Many blocks either have hard to understand, vague descriptions, or lack one altogether. I love to use this app, but it and the mod team has many issues.
