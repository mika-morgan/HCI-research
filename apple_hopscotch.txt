I love hopscotch and it truly has encouraged me to learn other coding languages and get involved with programming. I can confidently say that hopscotch not only teaches you about coding, but it teaches kids problem solving, applying math and logic skills, perseverance, patience and so much more. I always loved spending summer days coding games and then being able to publish these games for other kids to play! This is definitely a great app for kids of all ages and all coding skill levels. Wether or not your child wants to be a professional game developer, this app will benefit them in so many ways and teach them so many important skills.\n\nAs for the people who dislike the subscription, you can still use hopscotch for free! The subscription is optional and gives you access to more features, but there is still a fully functional free version.

The chance that my project might never be seen doesn\u2019t make me feel motivated enough to start coding. I am also disappointed that you have to sign up for a free trial, or as a student or teacher. This new way of signing up for the app is really confusing, and my friend just decided not to get it. I think that the app should just start off being free, and if the user really wants the premium features they could choose to subscribe.\n\nEdit: So I have been on Hopscotch some more and I now really miss old hopscotch.

Since then, we have changed the nature of the Hopscotch community. Now, every project your child sees in the app is hand-picked by a member of the Hopscotch team for its coding prowess and educational value. I can confidently say that your child finding a phone number on the community could not happen today.\nIn the past, we did allow children to publish their projects into a moderated feed. We used a combination of automatic and human moderation to filter every project that was shared. Despite these safeguards, there are thousands of projects shared in Hopscotch every day and your son encountered a case where an inappropriate project made it through our filters. We deeply regret that this occurred. The potential for situations like this is why we changed our community model at the beginning of this year.\nAs a parent you have every right to be concerned for your child\u2019s safety online. At Hopscotch, safety is of the utmost importance to us, and we strive every day to ensure that children can learn from one another in a safe and welcoming manner. If you have additional concerns or want to share more information about your son\u2019s experience please reach out to us at hello@gethopscotch.com.

Every piece of text is filtered, and every image used within a game is approved by a human. There is no commenting or messaging ability in the app, although publishers do get notifications if someone remixes their project. We also have checks on general game themes and a rigorous flagging system for games that fail the moderation checks. Users who repeatedly fail moderation checks are removed from the system. However, a minority of users determined to get around these sometimes find new ways to do so, and it seems like you saw those who did. We are always trying to improve our system and would appreciate learning more details and specifics about the offensive projects you saw.

I really wish you could give all content to me, and if you do, thank you. I will reinstall this. I\u2019ll give it 3 \u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f\u2b50\ufe0f STARS. By the way, could you make more apps? Like Hopscotch Pixel Art, Hopscotch Illusions, Hopscotch Puzzles, Hopscotch Games, Hopscotch Art, Hopscotch Music, Hopscotch Videos, Hopscotch Books, Hopscotch Reveal, etc?

Also, another teeny problem, is that I put in my dad\u2019s email, but it says That email is already taken or is 5e wrong format, even though that is the correct version of my dad\u2019s email. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s wrong with that. Also, nobody else knows my dad\u2019s email, what in the world? So when that happened I said \u201cUgh, stupid game.\u201d, then I automatically left the app. Sorry about that, but really, that\u2019s the stupid part. So you can\u2019t give me the content yet. But you better fix that, or I\u2019ll uninstall again. But I really don\u2019t wanna! I don\u2019t want to uninstall this app, but the stupid part is that my dad\u2019s email can\u2019t be taken and I swear I put it in right."}

Am I still am with it. It\u2019s super fun, allows you to create anything you can imagine, and is super educational in a fun way! There are a few flaws that are bothering me though.\n1. To create an account, you need a parent to try the subscription. When you open Hopscotch for the first time, it says you need a parent. This is not much of a problem. The problem is parents might think this is a paid app posing as a free app. I\u2019m not saying this was done on purpose. I\u2019m just saying the app and the features as opposed to a free version could have been shown better.\n2. Account management. I had Hopscotch on both my iPad and my iPhone. And a year or so ago, to free up space on my iPhone, I deleted Hopscotch. When I had a coding idea sometime after, I had to redownload the app on my phone (which was faster than my iPad). The only problem was, I couldn\u2019t remember the password. And I couldn\u2019t retrieve it either. You can\u2019t see it in the app and the email address I used then I don\u2019t use anymore. So I am a bit forced to play it on my (slow) iPad Mini.\nAs I said, these aren\u2019t really infuriating me. Just rather annoying me. Thanks for reading.\n\n-Coder and reviewer, Stonley890\u2122\nP.S. I still highly recommend Hopscotch!\n\nEDIT: Minor problem. So, on my iPad, I have the subscription features. Even though I\u2019m not subscribed. Like drawing objects and photos. But for  some strange reason, not custom avatar. Why is this? And how?", "isEdited": true}

It's wasteful in my opinion to have to subscribe to every single app you download. It's really just idiotic and massively expensive actually.\n\nIf this app was sold for one fair price I would probably purchase it without hesitation. But, I refuse to rent applications and to be forced to have to pay forever to use them. It's an application not a service. Even with occasional updates and new programming languages added here, this program and its greedy developers could never hope to justify charging users forever to rent or lease Hopscotch. Just how much money do these greedy developers believe everyone has? To be asked to rent and pay forever on every single you app you download is insane and monumentally stupid I think.\n\nRight next to in-app purchases, allowing any and every developer to demand a subscription to fully unlock their app, is the absolute worst decision Apple has ever made in my opinion.\n\nPlus, I doubt many of these subscription plan developers even realize this fact. But, with so many developers today adding subscriptions to their apps, overall app purchases and even downloads will go drastically down in the long run. That's because very few people can afford to subscribe to every app that they download on to their devices. And many of the ones who can afford it actually have the good financial sense not to waste their money in this idiotic way. So, developers like this one are really shooting themselves in the foot ultimately by demanding payments forever to rent their applications. Apps and just apps, not services. Developers fed themselves and made a good profit before this unethical trend to add subscriptions to everything commenced and ruined the app marketplace.\n\nIn the end it's just greed and avarice that dictates these subscription decisions and no amount of pathetic excuses from these types of developers will ever rationalize or justify asking customers to pay forever to rent their apps and games.", "isEdited": false, "rating": 2}

Me, being able to make my own game AWESOMENESS!!!!!!! It is a little hard, but once you get the hang of everything you'll be able to make any type of game all ON YOUR OWN!!!!!! Squeee! THANK YOU soooooo much for the videos. Those things are extremely helpful. But, speaking of videos there is something that to me, is a bit frustrating. And I can't figure it out on my own. So like yesterday  I was learning to make flappy bird, but then when I had died y'all didn't show us how to make it come back, but you could make it come back. And also I haven't been playing hopscotch for a really long time but I can tell you one thing. All the videos you make should really have detailed instructions. I told my friends about this app and 1 of them deleted cause it was complicated. Also you should show us in some of the videos where you can score points you should show us how to do that to. Because it can be really hard. \nOther than that this app is amazing! I will keep hopscothing and make more games, stories, music, and MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

{"date": "2014-05-11 00:05:48", "review": "In Hopscotch, you have events and actions. \u201cWhen the iPad is tilted left\u201d do this thing. It\u2019s really straightforward, and gets kids moving quickly. My daughter understood it much more readily than Scratch. The app looks terrific, and the metaphor of switching from Edit to Play is very well done.\n\nThe problem comes when you want to do anything more complicated than characters moving around and bumping into each other. Within a move statement, you can\u2019t check a value, so you have no idea where your character is on the stage. You can create other dummy characters for boundaries, but it\u2019s very awkward.\n\nYou can set values (think global variables), but you can\u2019t have one object/character send a message to another object/character like you can in Scratch. To get around this, you can have one object directly change the values of another object. It\u2019s a bad habit to teach young coders.\n\nUltimately, my daughter kept asking things that Hopscotch couldn\u2019t do because of logic and messages. Things like, \u201cWhen this character gets here, I want this character to jump over there.\u201d\n\nStill, Hopscotch is really well-designed, and I hope we\u2019ll return to it as more features are added.", "isEdited": false, "title": "Mostly terrific, but lack of IF-type logic and messaging makes some things harder than necessary", "rating": 5, "userName": "johnaugust"}

{"date": "2013-05-24 14:32:48", "review": "I really like this app, I was able to work around the flaws and make some pretty good games and cards. There are some improvements, however, that you could do to make this app much better. First of all, you need to be a to to link objects. There have been countless times where I thought of making a game and realized I couldn't because I couldn't link objects. For example, when making a game where a person is eating food (I used emoji from the text object feature), you would want the food to disappear when the human and burger come in contact. If you release an update with this feature, remember to include the ability to link lines  and characters (handy in mazes). Also, the costume changes are weak. I could only make an animation of a character spazzing out with this. When I saw the \"change costume\", I thought you would be able to make a new outfit for your story characters. Lastly, it would be great if you could import pictures to make your game/stories more interactive (Import a picture of someone, then costume change them to match your game a voila! They're in the game!)\n\nI know this review just seems like a list of demands but trust me, if you want this app to be as good as warioware ds or Scratch, you'll need these features.", "isEdited": false, "title": "A great app for learning the elements of coding but...", "rating": 4, "userName": "Xenotech2009"}

It's an excellent coding app for kids that leads them to Java and is easier to use than Scratch, especially for younger kids.  I totally understand adding new features and a subscription fee to support development, but $8/month?  That's excessive.  I would rather have you charge .99 for the app, or make the monthly fee reasonable.  I would absolutely invest for about 1/4 that fee.  We can't even try it out for free under a trial period to see if the bells and whistles might be worth it.  My son is so disappointed.  He got teary even telling me that it was $8/month because he knew that meant he wouldn't be able to use the new features.\n\nWe don't subscribe to the other apps you cited as reference either because there are so many great free or very inexpensive resources out there, Hopscotch was included.  We're going to have to switch to Scratch from MIT and for less than the annual fee this app would cost, we can invest in an Ozobot for $60 and use Google Blockly to program it for free.

It makes it very approachable and non-threatening. It's like Logo was back in the day where most people just started out by getting the turtle to draw some shapes then later realized (or not) that you could actually do some pretty sophisticated programming with it.\n\nIt might even be a good idea to have two versions eventually; this one basically as it is named Hopscotch Starter, and a more capable Scratch-like version called Hopscotch Pro.", "isEdited": false, "title": "Great for a beta version", "rating": 4, "userName": "sclincoln"}

I actually could code games and understand how I can code, it was life changing for me. But then I joined the Hopscotch Forum, (a official online place where you can meet other Hopscothers) It was also game changing for me, I got really good amd I started to make some games. The Community loved it and encouraged me to make more. Now I can make pixel art and use string and debug games if they help.\n\nSo if you want your child to have a successful life.

They can be exchanged for seeds 10 hop-coins = 1 seed. They can be purchased for real money. (100, 200, 500, 1000, and 2000.) 7: Hop-coin block. Speaking of hop-coins, the hop-coin block let\u2019s you purchase a pass for hop-coins and seeds (Maximum amount of hop-coins is 2000.) 8: Pop-up notifications, you can only receive a pop-up if you are playing hopscotch. They can be disabled on the settings. 9: Custom sounds, Addable in files and voice recording. 10: Sound edit, You can increase or decrease speed, pitch, and sound. (Maximum for each is %500.

{"date": "2021-04-20 00:12:04", "review": "This is a fine app it\u2019s strange the thing is the reason people would use this tool is because it is an easy way to code and program \nThe code for a lot of things to make a fun game is way harder than it seems at first becuse this app lacks a lot of key command types so you may end up doing huge lumps of code and complex math equations to do things that would be easy in other game engines\nI know people are not supposed to take this seriously and think of this as a \u201clearning tool\u201d as a learning tool it helped me I\u2019m strangely born with a talent of code it though and as a learning tool this would likely alienate many kids who are the target audience here. people who have no idea about programming and for that they will make some games and then uninstall shortly after probably i bet only a few people stayed on this. This has to compete with scratch however and on that department it fails first of all scratch let\u2019s you animate things for free but for this you have to pay an overpriced membership to animate on your own this frankly is stupid dumb stupid and dumb. This makes it a weirdly \u201cpay to win\u201d programming tool in a way I have not seen before as I mentioned before about how you have to do complex math and huge lumps of code to do some simple things ANIMATING SPRITES is the hardest thing ever to do with no money you have to use one million squares and shapes color them in and have them move about in one huge swarm with different colors HUGE GAME COMPANIES would bail on even trying to do that for many reasons including a huge frame rate drop huge money and effort and a huge development crunch you have to pay do that or have your games look terrible. I would not complain about this if scratch did not make you do an expensive subscription to DRAW YOUR OWN SPRITES AND ALSO IMPORT IMAGES this made you have to use the template animations that are not great at all this app has stiff competition in the programming tool for kids area and this fails hard at competing and I bet a lot of the kids who use this just don\u2019t know about scratch I dot like scratch eather but still that\u2019s what this would be compared to the games here are mostly just simple mini games that you would only play for 30 seconds or less and I understand why. This does not want to be a real game makeing software and the simple block code makes for simple games simple boring games overall if you want a little kid simple code tool get scratch and if you don\u2019t know how to code but want to make a great game get Gdevelop in conclusion \nSubscription thing is stupid:\nScratch is overall better:\nWay harder than it looks if you want to make any fun game at all:\nNot good for teaching kids how to code most will quit early bc your target is 10 year olds and they will be board:\n\nAlso I am not comparing it to the level of any professional game I am putting it in a fair line of comparison \nAnd also sorry for any spelling errors I\u2019m 12\nAlso on another note glad you respond to your feed back\n\nSuggestions: make the thing less pay to win dont make your consumers have to pay to not use your templete images let that be free and have the subscriptoin do something else becuse otherwise they will just get scratch\n\nAdd more commands like follow an object or something \nAnd  a Phlatforming feture becuse the phlatforming currently is terrible. \n\nOverall: liked it before dont remember it fondly\nAnd as an intro to codeing: outdone by scratch but good \nBut remove or lessen the pay to win PLEASE kids are HUGE TARGETS for pay to win and the subscriptoin thing is very bad to put in a learning tool. And scratch asks for nothing so why put it here all it does is give your consumers a great reason to use scratch instead\nAlso WHY DID YOU LET PEOPLE PUT MICROTRANSACTOINS IN THEIR GAMES WHAT WERE YOU THINKING \nBut i did learn to code from this app so its not bad", "rating": 3, "userName": "Nshmore", "isEdited": false, "title": "I\u2019m a kid I used to use this but moved on here is my opinion looking back"}

This is the less important one. You don\u2019t get noticed unless you\u2019re a long time curated coder. Everyone makes, no one looks. Maybe update the \u2018newest\u2019 bar or replace it with something better. Or maybe you could promote a few more coders that also work hard!\n\n2. This one is FAR more serious. A week ago, I started making a cooking game using a tutorial. I had a spoon ready, but it kept getting stuck at the middle of the screen, completely disobeying code. I could drag my ingredients, but they wouldn\u2019t disappear once they bumped the pot. I thought it was probably nothing, maybe that certain game was corrupted. I closed out of it, deleted it, and went onto making a new one. I made Heads Up just great! Then, I started on a tapper game. I placed my emoji, and couldn\u2019t even get past the first line of code before the \u2018\ud83d\ude36 Whomp! Something went wrong\u2019 pops up. I reload the game, same message. I try entering my other games, then suddenly, none of them load. Other games that aren\u2019t mine work amazing, but I can\u2019t make anything. I give hopscotch a few day break. I come back on  about yesterday only to see that I can only remix projects. I take another break, then come back today. Suddenly, no projects work.

Another thing I think would be great, is if MAYBE you could make a way to get someone\u2019s Attention besides Remixing or Liking?

{"title": "I Love this App! 4 Stars", "review": "I love this app! It is fun, yet educational. Each User can Explore the Great World of Coding kid style. The app makes it easy to code games and such.

Kids can learn to code using tutorials and create games with the coding tools they have. They can publish their work and people can like their game, etc. Even though the thought of liking \u201cposted projects\u201d may sound kind of mature for kids to some paranoid parents, Hopscotch is a safe, fun and educational community!

{"title": "Good coding, Not so good updates.", "review": "This is a great coding app because it gives you actual code instead of commands like move, and jump. Hopscotch is one of my go-to apps when I\u2019m bored, but the new updates about seeds and mushrooms are pointless and make you have to spend more money.\nYou have to pay a bunch of money for seeds to watch a few tutorials, and get images and drawings. This use to come with subscription, but now subscription only comes with one or two more free tutorials and unlimited remixes. Now because of seeds, subscription seems like a ripoff for $7.99 a month or $79.99 for a year. Paying for 50 seeds costs $2.99 and you can only watch one tutorial or unlock drawings or images. Pathetic job trying to drain people\u2019s money.\nThe latest update was that you can trade 5 seeds for a mushroom and if someone really likes your project, they give you a mushroom. Basically, what Hopscotch is saying is that people can pay money to put a plant into a project. First of all, I would of rated this app better if every mushroom you get you can trade to seeds, second of all, why the heck would you pay money to show appreciation to your favorite projects when you could show their appreciation by simply giving them likes and follows?\nTo sum it up, Hopscotch is trying to get more money from you than before for the same or less value it\u2019s driving me insane.", "userName": "MARIOISAWESOME6382", "date": "2020-07-24 11:22:53", "rating": 3, "developerResponse": {"id": 16899260, "body": "Hi there, thanks for your feedback.

I used to play it all the time.\n\nI decided to revisit Hopscotch to relive past memories, so I reinstalled it and gave it a go. I was disappointed to see the game I once loved, which was free at the time, now insist that you must pay for a subscription to code.\n\nFirst of all, I do not understand why Hopscotch developers chose for a subscription. This is a marketing trick that ultimately fails. Why pay monthly or yearly when you can just buy the app when you download it? This also \u201cscares away\u201d potential customers. The ability to purchase the app would be much more useful than a monthly subscription.\n\nSecond of all, why pay for the game when you can use Scratch instead? Scratch is essentially the same, however it is free to use. 60$ a year compared to nothing at all is a bit much.\n\nIn summary, I am sad to see Hopscotch change into a money-oriented application instead of a place solely used for kids to create, learn, and have fun.\n\nKind regards, \nA Cheetah", "userName": "Pikalynx4", "isEdited": false, "title": "Used to love it but..."}

Due to poor updates and constant user interface changes, this app has gone from a powerful and simple coding platform to an overly simple, buggy mess. I was coding on the most recent version and my project had 44 different sprites. When you have more than ten sprites on the current interface, it gets very very unintuitive. This is  because you are constantly forced to scroll and scroll to find a particular Sprite. On top of things like this, when putting in numbers, the small keypad isn't even in the right order! It went 1,8,4,2,6 or something similarly out of order. All in all, this app used to be a powerful coding platform for all ages, from people just learning to code, to experienced coders just testing or sketching out ideas. It has turned into an unintuitive app with very convoluted and unnecessary features. This is either going to get fixed or not, but the bottom line is that if this continues, Hopscotch will lose many valued users and eventually it's going to become obsolete and disregarded, despite how nice it was at one point.

The hopscotch team inspired me to become a coder myself when I grow up. I love coding and it has definitely become a part of me. I am so grateful for the hopscotch team that they have created this app for kids like me. Sometimes, I find myself thinking about what the code would be for other apps, computers, watches, etc. I just can't stop myself.\n\n    The hopscotch team is so kind and generous. I have emailed them more than enough to ask for help and they always answer with a well-thought through paragraph. I know that they work hard to keep Hopscotch going, and on top of all this amazingness, they make the game completely free!! \n\n    It is fun and easy to create games with all the step by step videos and once you become more experienced, you can step away from the videos and use what they have taught you to make new and different things. \n\n   You can learn from other coders of the hopscotch community to help make yourself a better coder too. It is always fun to chat and give/recieve help on the hopscotch forum too.
