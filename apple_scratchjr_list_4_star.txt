{"star_rating": "4", "review": "There is this mail letter thing, you can choose different colors for it to trigger a signal in your coding thing, or, whatever you call what it does. There is only a few colors, not a lot. I don\u2019t like that part, because I have a lot more things to use that mail thingy than just 6 colors. Can we maybe put a text, instead of colors? Like, any text. For example: \u201ccar\u201d. And on the character, you put the same text on that mail thingy. And the action happens. Also, why only 4 scenes? Can we add more than 4 scenes? I also want the audio recording quality a little better. There is this noise sound, it makes the recording sound a little glitchy, I also want to have a feature where you can just get audio from your audio library, or video library. \nThank you, I just want an improvement to make coding better. Overall from this, this app is great! Thank you for reading.", "date": "2020-11-26 18:25:58"}

On scratch Junior you can make stories and if you don\u2019t like the color of the character then you can change the color. And if you do not like how small it is or how Big is it then you can change the size. It is The coolest game my brother and I have saw. You can also change the background. The coolest thing you can do is make the characters move around. Another thing is that can make the characters talk.", "date": "2021-07-17 21:36:02"}

{"star_rating": "4", "review": "Scratch Jr is a great app to get kids to learn how to code young. it\u2019s simple, understandable, and has so many possibilities. I\u2019ve had it for years because of how easy it is to make a game or story of my own. However, please add an advanced mode into the game. With only 6 messages to that can be sent and only 4 slides, it really restricts the possibilities. It would at least be nice to have an option to turn off rainbow messages and instead have the names messages so there can be infinite. Also please have a section where kids or kids\u2019s parents or even kids\u2019s teachers can publish their creations to some sort of in app media.
